# Flare
Flare is an open source social media platform. The goal is to have a high quality open source alternative to main stream social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. 

## Features
Currently there is: 
* Registration
* login
* profile pictures
* email verification for registration
* posting (yet the ability ability to view posts is still in the works)

## What Needs to Be added
Here is a list of My Todos for Flare:
* View Posts
* Search for Posts or Users
* Following
* Likes
* DMs (Direct messaging)
* CSS Rework

## The Code
Currently Flare is written in PHP.
For styling it is using CSS.
For the database I am using MySQL.

## Setting Up the SQL
NEED TO ADD Commands to Set up the SQL Tables

## Deployment
To deploy your own version of Flare I'd Reccomend using Xampp.
Here is a list of steps for the set up in Xampp:
* Clone this repository into your folder for apache 
* Open Xampp and Turn on Apache and MySQL
* Go to localhost/myphpadmin 
* set up the sql following the steps in the Setting Up the SQL section
* Port forward your website!

### Notes
* I need to add the setup for the MySQL
* Adding Screen Shots would be helpful
